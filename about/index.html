        <p>I am a Licensed Psychologist Associate specializing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, including psychotherapy and psychological evaluation. I have extensive experience supporting the mental health needs of children and families over the past {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2001 }} years. I value tailoring my approach in therapy to your child by drawing from my experience to provide a mix of evidence-based treatments, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). I have served as Board President for the Oregon Chapter of the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science, the preeminent organization for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a contemporary cognitive behavioral therapy. I’m also a member of the Oregon Psychological Association and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.</p>

        <p>Outside of my private practice work, I enjoy my time with the woman I love and our children and family. Everyday I look forward to coming home to a warm greeting from our affectionate Blenheim Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Separate from my private practice, I have been the Director of Student Support at a K-8 French-immersion school for {% assign le_monde = site.time | date: "%m" | plus:0 %}{% if le_monde > 8 %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2015 }}{% else %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2016 }}{% endif %} school years, and I am proud to be a part of our small team of teachers and staff who have built a uniquely wonderful public school, supporting our students as they excel academically and in so many other ways. In my free time, I like to learn new things and spend time with family, sharing a good meal, board game, movie, audiobook, or walk outdoors with our dog. Sometimes people ask about the initial in place of my first name&mdash;even though Charles has always been my first name, I have always gone by my middle name, David, so I follow the convention used by Poet <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://poets.org/poet/n-scott-momaday">N.
