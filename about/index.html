        <p>Psychotherapy is not easy to describe, and it varies from therapist to therapist. I use <strong>cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT), which is an <strong>evidence-based</strong> psychotherapy, meaning that it is informed by scientific research supporting its effectiveness. I draw from <strong>both classic and more contemporary CBT techniques</strong> that have research support for their effectiveness. In therapy sessions, I work with the child, parents, or both, depending on what we’re doing. I am often interacting with what you bring to our meetings to apply these techniques to real life. Most people come to me having already tried many strategies, and often our work is <strong>learning new strategies</strong> and figuring out how to <strong>use familiar strategies in a different way</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Before beginning therapy, I meet with just the parents</strong> (without the child) to complete necessary paperwork, gather a wide variety of <strong>background information</strong> I need to understand how I might be able to help (e.g., developmental and family history), and hear from parents about what <strong>goals they have for therapy</strong>. Parents sometimes come to me feeling desperate, having already tried many things, or disagreeing about what to do&mdash;<strong>being a parent, I know what it’s like,</strong> and I’m guided by <strong>compassion</strong> for you as we look for ways to help your child and unite your efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>Then I meet with the child</strong> because <strong>I want to hear from the child</strong> about how things have been going and what <strong>goals</strong> they might be willing to work toward in therapy. Many children don’t understand that <strong>a <i>therapeutic relationship</i> is different</strong> from all the other relationships they have with adults, so I usually need to start by explaining <strong>confidentiality</strong> and that <strong>I’m on their side</strong> with them in a <i>working alliance</i>. This intake process helps me evaluate what strategies might be useful and <strong>what everyone wants</strong> to get out of therapy.</p>

		<p>Outside of my private practice work, I enjoy my time with my love and our children and family, and everyday I look forward to coming home to a warm greeting from our affectionate Blenheim Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Separate from my private practice, I have been the Director of Student Support at a K-8 French-immersion school for {% assign le_monde = site.time | date: "%m" | plus:0 %}{% if le_monde > 8 %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2015 }}{% else %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2016 }}{% endif %} school years, and I am proud to be a part of our small team of teachers and staff who have built a uniquely wonderful public school, supporting our students as they excel academically and otherwise in so many ways. In my free time, I like to learn new things and spend time with family, sharing a good meal, movie, or audiobook. Sometimes people ask about the initial in place of my first name&mdash;even though Charles has always been my first name, I have always gone by my middle name, David, so I follow the example of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/F-Scott-Fitzgerald" target="_blank">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> and <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/L-Frank-Baum" target="_blank">L. Frank Baum</a>.</p>
