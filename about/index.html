        <p>I’m a Licensed Psychologist Associate specializing in Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, including psychotherapy and psychological evaluation. I’ve maintained my private practice in Tigard for {% assign private_practice = site.time | date: "%m" | plus:0 %}{% if private_practice > 3 %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2018 }}{% else %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2019 }}{% endif %} years, and I have extensive experience providing mental health services to children and youth over the past {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2001 }} years. My approach is rooted in thoroughly assessing your child’s needs and thoughtfully selecting evidence-based treatments, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), behavior management, collaborative problem-solving, and others. In my professional community, I have served as Board President for the Oregon Chapter of the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science, and I’m a member of the American Psychological Association, the Oregon Psychological Association, and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. I have also served on boards of non-profit community organizations.</p>

        <p>Separate from my private practice, I have been the Director of Student Support at Le Monde, a small K-8 French-immersion public charter school with about 400 students, for {% assign le_monde = site.time | date: "%m" | plus:0 %}{% if le_monde > 8 %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2015 }}{% else %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2016 }}{% endif %} school years. All of my other experience has been in mental health settings (i.e., not connected to a school). I am still learning French&mdash;I don’t speak as well as the students, but I can usually understand what others are saying. Our students have repeatedly outperformed the best public schools in the area on important metrics, even though we operate on a smaller budget. We’ve been doing this by being open-minded about how we teach students and how we provide accommodations and interventions for students with academic, behavioral, emotional, or social challenges. My work at the school has involved direct student support, coordinating with outside providers, consulting with teachers and staff about mental health topics, maintaining Section 504 plans, and collaborating with Special Education. My work at the school certainly informs my private practice work, but it is separate from the school. To help maintain that separation, my private practice is not for Le Monde students. I do work through my private practice with children and youth attending other schools because Le Monde is separate from the school district&mdash;I am not an employee of Portland Public Schools (or any other school district).</p>

        <p>Outside of work, I enjoy my time with the woman I love and our children and family. Everyday I look forward to coming home to a warm greeting from our affectionate Blenheim Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. In my free time, I like to learn new things and spend time with family, sharing a good meal, board game, movie, audiobook, or walk outdoors with our dog. Sometimes people ask about the initial in place of my first name&mdash;even though Charles has always been my first name, I have always gone by my middle name, David, so I follow the convention used by Poet <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://poets.org/poet/n-scott-momaday">N.&nbsp;Scott Momaday</a>, Actress <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0580924/bio">S.&nbsp;Epatha Merkerson</a>, Activist <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.biography.com/activist/a-philip-randolph">A.&nbsp;Philip Randolph</a>, Novelist <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/american-literature-biographies/e-annie-proulx">E.&nbsp;Annie Proulx</a>, Filmmaker <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0796117/bio">M.&nbsp;Night Shyamalan</a> and others.</p>
