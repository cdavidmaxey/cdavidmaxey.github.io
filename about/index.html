		<p>C. David Maxey is the Past-President of the Board of the Oregon Chapter of the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science, which advances a contextual behavioral approach that emphasizes such processes as mindfulness and clarifying values to help children thrive. He has a wide variety of experience supporting children and families. After earning his undergraduate degree from the University of Mississippi, David worked as a case manager for children in the Mississippi Delta, a racially and economically diverse rural community. As their primary service provider, he visited the children, their parents, and their teachers at least monthly and developed an ability to see the problems the children faced from a variety of perspectives and as influenced by many factors. Wanting to develop his skills helping children and families, he embarked on graduate training in clinical psychology with a concentration in children and families at Bowling Green State University, well-known for its accredited graduate program. There in Ohio, he developed his skills by providing services to many children and families. He also worked in elementary school classrooms, facilitating problem-solving and aggression-reduction primary prevention programs. He connected research and practice through prevention program research, evaluations of a variety of programs, and reviews of clinical services. After earning his Master’s degree in Psychology, David took a primary caregiver role in his family to support his partner, as she pursued her career, but while at home, David continued to stay connected to his professional community, through service roles, and attending continuing education opportunities.

		<p>David is now a Psychologist Associate Resident (Daniel J. Munoz, Ph.D., Psychologist, Supervisor) working as Director of Student Support at Le Monde French Immersion Public Charter School, where he provides psychological services to elementary students, works with teachers to implement interventions and classroom management strategies, facilitates the school’s coordination with Special Education providers, and organizes primary prevention programs. David is also Co-Chair of Le Monde Immersion’s Equity and Inclusivity in Education committee, where he brings a wealth of experience and training in the intersection of mental health and diversity, especially as it relates to gender and sexual minorities, religious people, and people of color.</p>
		<p>David also has a private psychology practice, offering appointments after school hours, on weekends, and over school breaks at his office in the Tigard Triangle area of Portland, Oregon near the junction of I-5 and 217. He specializes in evidence-based psychotherapy and psychological evaluation for school-age children and teens, with a concentration in support for challenging behavior at school or home; anxiety and depression; difficulties with inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity; and gender-related issues or dysphoria experienced by trans and gender-expansive children and youth.</p>

		<p>My style is often quite pragmatic, interacting with what children, parents, and teachers bring to our meetings. Sometimes, it’s useful to teach and practice strategies that have been shown to be highly effective, and then follow up by troubleshooting these techniques to fit them to your child within the many contexts of their life. Parents sometimes come to me feeling desperate, having already tried many things, or disagreeing about what to do&mdash;being a parent, I know what it’s like, and I’m guided by compassion for you as we look for ways to unite each of your efforts to help your child.</p>
		<p>I use evidence-based techniques, which means that my work is informed by empirical research identifying those methods that scientific research has shown to be effective. I also consider your child’s strengths and what they like, so we can leverage those strengths and likes to help your child succeed. I do not subscribe to an illness or disease model of psychology&mdash;I tend to avoid words like symptom, mental disorder, or initialisms like ADHD because I find it more useful to discuss specific challenges. Nonetheless, I fully support families who find a mental disorder diagnosis useful for helping their children develop insight into their difficulties, access resources and support, etc.</p>

		<p>I honor all loving family structures including those with parents who are gender or sexual minorities (LGBT), polyamorous, separating or divorcing, divorced, single parents by choice, or coparenting in non-traditional arrangements. I support the full spectrum of gender expression (e.g., boy, girl, gender-expansive, transgender and intersex), and I affirm sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay and bi). I respect all forms of diversity including religious and spiritual beliefs. When youth are facing difficult decisions, I encourage thoughtful consideration of the wide variety of choices.</p>
		<p>Sometimes people ask about my name. I grew up in Mississippi&mdash;there, it’s common to go by your middle name for your whole life. Charles has always been my first name, and I have always been called David. I invite you to call me David too. When I write my name, I typically use my initial in place of my first name, like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=A.+Philip+Randolph" target="_blank">A. Philip Randolph</a> (Founder of the first predominantly African-American labor union and Director of the 1963 March on Washington culminating in Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream” speech), <a rel="nofollow" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=E.+Annie+Proulx" target="_blank">E.
