        <p><strong>I am a Licensed Psychologist Associate specializing in clinical child and adolescent psychotherapy and psychological assessment.</strong> I have extensive experience supporting the mental health needs of children and families over the past {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2001 }} years. I have served as Board President for the Oregon Chapter of the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science, the preeminent organization for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. I’m also a member of the Oregon Psychological Association and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.</p>

        <p><strong>Psychotherapy is not easy to describe, and it varies from therapist to therapist.</strong> I use <strong>cognitive behavioral therapy</strong> (CBT), which is an <strong>evidence-based</strong> psychotherapy, meaning that it is informed by scientific research supporting its effectiveness. I draw from <strong>both classic and more contemporary CBT techniques</strong> that have research support for their effectiveness. In therapy sessions, I work with the child, parents, or both, depending on what we’re doing. I am often interacting with what you bring to our meetings to apply these techniques to real life. Most people come to me having already tried many strategies, and often our work is <strong>learning new strategies</strong> and figuring out how to <strong>use familiar strategies in a different way</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Before beginning therapy, I meet with just the parents</strong> (without the child) to complete necessary paperwork, gather a wide variety of <strong>background information</strong> I need to understand how I might be able to help (e.g., developmental and family history), and hear from parents about what <strong>goals they have for therapy</strong>. Parents sometimes come to me feeling desperate, having already tried many things, or disagreeing about what to do&mdash;<strong>being a parent, I know what it’s like,</strong> and I’m guided by <strong>compassion</strong> for you as we look for ways to help your child and unite your efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>Then I meet with the child</strong> because <strong>I want to hear from the child</strong> about how things have been going and what <strong>goals</strong> they might be willing to work toward in therapy. Many children don’t understand that <strong>a <i>therapeutic relationship</i> is different</strong> from all the other relationships they have with adults, so I usually need to start by explaining <strong>confidentiality</strong> and that <strong>I’m on their side</strong> with them in a <i>working alliance</i>. This intake process helps me evaluate what strategies might be useful and <strong>what everyone wants</strong> to get out of therapy.</p>
        <p><strong>I strive to provide culturally-responsive mental health services</strong>, and I’ve had training and experience specifically in services for people of color, religious minorities, LGBTQ folks, transgender youth, and people facing mental health stigma (e.g., of having ADHD, dyslexia or depression). I have also learned from personal contact with racism and other forms of prejudice and discrimination while attending predominantly Black urban middle and high schools as well as a predominantly white suburban high school; taking a lead role in research experiments about racism at the University of Mississippi, a generation after James Meredith struggled to integrate it; and working in mental health clinics in the rural Mississippi Delta as well as the Midwest. Nonetheless, I recognize that I’m a straight white able-bodied cisgender male who’s benefited from privilege I haven’t earned. I know I can’t fully understand the discrimination experienced by some of the children and families I serve, and I commit to try, by continuing to educate myself and believing you when you share your lived experience.</p>

        <p>Outside of my private practice work, I enjoy my time with my love and our children and family, and everyday I look forward to coming home to a warm greeting from our affectionate Blenheim Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Separate from my private practice, I have been the Director of Student Support at a K-8 French-immersion school for {% assign le_monde = site.time | date: "%m" | plus:0 %}{% if le_monde > 8 %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2015 }}{% else %}{{site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2016 }}{% endif %} school years, and I am proud to be a part of our small team of teachers and staff who have built a uniquely wonderful public school, supporting our students as they excel academically and in so many other ways. In my free time, I like to learn new things and spend time with family, sharing a good meal, board game, movie, or audiobook. Sometimes people ask about the initial in place of my first name&mdash;even though Charles has always been my first name, I have always gone by my middle name, David, so I follow the example of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://poets.org/poet/n-scott-momaday">N.
