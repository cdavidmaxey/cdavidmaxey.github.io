Playdates and small get-togethers are a great time for kids to play with close friends. They can play with little bounds, creatively making up “games” and activities by building on each other’s ideas, as they imagine together. Such powerful experiences deepen friendships and strengthen friend groups. Wanting to maintain their friendship, kids are motivated to resolve the inevitable conflicts. Everyone invited plays together and has a wonderful time.

Some kids seek out their friend group for this imaginative and creative play at school recesses (amongst 20+ other kids), and that can be just fine, if other kids (outside of their friend group) are invited to join in. Welcoming others to play tag or other well-established games is easy, but inviting others at recess to join in imaginative play requires intentionality. Kids often don’t <i>intend</i> to hurt others’ feelings, but when kids aren’t <i>intentional</i> about being inviting while at school, kids outside their friend group can become routinely excluded from connecting with others because “they don’t know the rules of our game.” 

The rules of these imaginative games are usually arbitrary and can end up being unfair because they’re made up along the way. Amongst close friends attuned to each others’ feelings, these rules are not exploited by those favored, are tolerated by those disadvantaged, and are changed when unfairness abounds. When these games are played with others outside their friend group, these social graces about unfair rules might not be extended to those outside the friend group, and teachers supervising 20+ kids at recess will probably miss these nuances.

Perspective-taking can help kids think about the differences between the contexts of recess and playdates to understand the impact of the way they play at recess. Kids in early elementary grades might struggle to understand and employ the nuanced social skills needed to be inviting to others during imaginative play at recess. They might benefit more from learning well-established recess games, and saving imaginative play for playdates with close friends. 

Banning certain games does not help kids learn cooperation, conflict resolution, or the many other skills learned through recess games. Instead, kids can learn to tag using light “butterfly fingers”; give high fives and say “good job, nice try” when peers rotate to the back of the line in Foursquare; or play fun variations on traditional playground games&mdash;like Crossover Dodgeball, where the goal is to get everyone to the other side and no one is “out”.

<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.playworks.org/game-library/">Playworks</a> offers a free guide to recess games with fair rules that are widely understood (and accepted) by kids. Their <a rel="nofollow" href="{{site.url}}/Playworks-Game-Guide.pdf">PDF guide (also linked above)</a> has an index that can be useful for finding suitable games that are fun for your child, but their <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.playworks.org/game-library/">online Games Library</a> can be easier to use because it can be filtered for type (e.g., "Recess Games" or "Tag Games"), group size, age, etc.
