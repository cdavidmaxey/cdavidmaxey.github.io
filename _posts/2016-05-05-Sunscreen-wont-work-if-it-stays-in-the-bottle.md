Sun exposure is a major well-established health risk, and there are a lot of resources for learning about how to be safe in the sun. This article is <i>not</i> advice about sun protection; discuss sun protection decisions and reports from sources such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/" data-inverted data-position="bottom center" data-tooltip="Enviromental Working Group">EWG</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/" data-inverted data-position="bottom center" data-tooltip="American Academy of Pediatrics">AAP</a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fda.gov/" data-inverted data-position="bottom center" data-tooltip="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">FDA</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/sunscreens.htm">Consumer Reports</a>, with your child’s primary medical provider. This article helps you consider ways to apply the information they provide&mdash;to think flexibly about making a habit of sun safety in your family. 

As children approach the teen years, they become more independant, and need to think for themselves about sun safety when you’re not around. Start the conversations early so you can prepare them to make healthy choices on their own. Here are some ways to start a conversation:

<ul class="compact paragraph tail">
	<li>Talk about scheduling outdoor activities to avoid the peak sun hours during the middle of the day, and brainstorm indoor activities to do in the middle of the day.</li>
	<li>Ask your child to check the UV index using a weather app&mdash;let them see that the UV index can be high on cold or cloudy days.</li>
	<li>Try on a rash guard swim shirt, “shorty” wetsuit, or hat to reduce the amount of exposed skin.</li>
	<li>Pack a beach umbrella or tent to bring some shade along with you.</li>
	<li>Take your child shopping for sunglasses and goggles. Show them how to check for UV protection (hint: not all dark-tinted lenses protect against UV rays, and some light-tinted lenses have UV protection).</li>
	<li>If your child wears glasses, ask your optometrist about UV protection&mdash;many lenses include UV protection.</li>
</ul>

	<li>SPF is a measure of protection only from UVB rays; “broad spectrum” sunscreen or sunblock protects against both UVB and UVA rays.</li>
	<li>Don’t misunderstand SPF ratings&mdash;SPF 50 and 100 block only about 1% and 2% more UVB rays than SPF 30, respectively.

	<li>Choose a water-resistant product if you’ll be in the water.</li>
	<li>Follow recommendations about applying the sunscreen <i>before</i> going out into the sun.</li>
	<li>A common mistake is applying too little&mdash;make sure you apply the correct amount.</li>
	<li>Applying adequately around the edges of a swimsuit can be challenging&mdash;consider applying before putting the swimsuit on.</li>
	<li>Don’t miss any exposed skin including toes, top and bottom of feet, underarms, neck and hairline, tops and backs of ears, and areas near the eyes.</li>
	<li>Reapply as recommended&mdash;using a high SPF does not mean that you can reapply less often.</li>
	<li>Dispose of old expired bottles.</li>
	<li>Products are sometimes divided into two categories: 1) sunscreens that absorb UV rays and 2) sunblocks that reflect UV rays. Sunblocks are harder to find in stores; New Seasons and Whole Foods usually carry sunblocks by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.badgerbalm.com/sunscreen"><strong>Badger Balm</strong></a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.californiababy.com/sunscreens.html"><strong>California Baby</strong></a>.</li>
