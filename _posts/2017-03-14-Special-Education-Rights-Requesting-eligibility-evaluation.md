<p>It can take a long time to get an evaluation for Special Education eligibility from your school. In Oregon, schools have 60 school days to complete an evaluation after a parent consents, and the school has to decide to offer an evaluation before a parent can consent to an evaluation. If you add up the time it takes a school to decide if they’ll offer an evaluation plus 60 school days plus weekends and holidays, that’s quite likely well over 3 months. I encourage you to make your request for an evaluation <i>in writing</i> with clear requests, your signature, and the date, so there are no misunderstandings that might delay the process (see example below).</p>
<section class="paper">
<p class="blue">[full name of parent]<br>[address of parent]</p>
<p class="blue">[date]</p>
<p class="blue">[name of school]<br>[address of school]</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I am <span class="blue">[full name of your child]</span>’s parent. My child has been struggling at school. <span class="blue">[Provide detailed information about your concerns, using supporting evidence such as test scores, teacher communications, work samples, etc.]</span></p>
<p>I have been working with <span class="blue">[name of your child’s teacher(s)]</span>, and <span class="blue">[I have not seen any improvement or the problems have been getting worse]</span>, despite having tried the following things. <span class="blue">[Describe any interventions that were tried, including response to intervention (RtI) and informal accommodations in the classroom]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing to formally request that my child be evaluated for special education services under the Child Find obligations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you within the next <span class="blue">[15 days]</span> to develop an assessment plan to begin the evaluation process. Please ensure that I receive copies of assessment results <span class="blue">[7 days]</span> prior to any meeting. Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Sometimes parents are concerned that if they consent to a full evaluation, they might be also consenting to special education&mdash;the Oregon Department of Education explains above that “consent for initial evaluation does not mean that you have also given your consent for&hellip;special education”, and you may revoke your consent. I encourage you to know your rights, and consider the value of a full evaluation so that you can make a well-informed decision about your child’s education.</p>
<p>You can follow the typical paths from an evaluation to an Individualized Education Program (IEP) in the infographic below from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/iep-roadmap-how-to-seek-out-special-education-services-for-your-child" target="_blank">Understood.org</a> and titled <i>IEP Roadmap: How to Seek Out Special Education Services for Your Child</i>, and the following table provides descriptions of disability categories of Special Education eligibility adapted from the Oregon Administrative Rules.</p>
