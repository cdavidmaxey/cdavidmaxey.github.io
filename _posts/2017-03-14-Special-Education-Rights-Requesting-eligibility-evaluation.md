<p>Your school&hellip;cannot conduct an initial evaluation&hellip;to determine eligibility&hellip;to receive special education&hellip;without first providing you with prior written notice&hellip;and obtaining your consent&hellip;.</p>

<p>It can take a long time to get an evaluation for Special Education eligibility from your school. In Oregon, schools have 60 school days to complete an evaluation after a parent consents, and the school has to decide to offer an evaluation before a parent can consent to an evaluation. If you add up the time it takes a school to decide if they’ll offer an evaluation plus 60 school days plus weekends and holidays, that’s quite likely well over 3 months. I encourage you to make your request for an evaluation <i>in writing</i> with clear requests, your signature, and the date, so there are no misunderstandings that might delay the process (see example below).</p>
<p>Sometimes parents are concerned that if they consent to a full evaluation, they might be also consenting to special education&mdash;the Oregon Department of Education explains above that “consent for initial evaluation does not mean that you have also given your consent for&hellip;special education”, and you may revoke your consent. I encourage you to know your rights, and consider the value of a full evaluation so that you can make a well-informed decision about your child’s education.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I am <span class="blue">[full name of your child]</span>’s parent. My child has been struggling at school. <span class="blue">[Provide detailed information about your concerns, using supporting evidence such as test scores, teacher communications, work samples, etc.]</span></p>
<p>I have been working with <span class="blue">[name of your child’s teacher(s)]</span>, and <span class="blue">[I have not seen any improvement or the problems have been getting worse]</span>, despite having tried the following things. <span class="blue">[Describe any interventions that were tried, including response to intervention (RtI) and informal accommodations in the classroom]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing to formally request that my child be evaluated for special education services under the Child Find obligations of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you within the next <span class="blue">[15 days]</span> to develop an assessment plan to begin the evaluation process. Please ensure that I receive copies of assessment results <span class="blue">[7 days]</span> prior to any meeting. Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
