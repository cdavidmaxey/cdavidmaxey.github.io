Many children struggle with developing a sense of time, and this is often a challenge for children with attention difficulties. Visual timers can be helpful to children having difficulty managing time, completing tasks, or transitioning at the end of an activity. My favorite visual timers are the 3.5-inch Time Timer MOD (pictured below on the left) and the 7-inch Time Timer Plus (pictured below on the right), which are available at <a href="https://timetimer.com/">TimeTimer.com</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/TimeTimer/TimeTimer/page/5078659D-EB1A-4D48-A006-123FBE37827B" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com</a>, and many other retailers.

<h3>Features</h3>
- The passage of time is represented by the red disk that disappears as time elapses.
- Children with limited number sense can usually understand how much time is represented by the timerâ€™s red disk.
- The timer has an elegant presentation that eliminates distracting details commonly added to physical timers or website timers (e.g., seconds, milliseconds, eyecatching graphics, ads, links, etc.).
