<strong>Chores &ne; Allowance.</strong> Chores can help children develop a sense of independance. Allowances can help children develop financial sensibilities. 

<strong>Helper > help.</strong> On average, 3- to 6-year-olds who had been prompted "to be a helper" tidyed up more than a simular group of children who has been prompted "to help" (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12244" target="_blank">Bryan, Master & Walton, 2014</a>).

<strong>Consider your child.</strong> Your child might find it easier to do a chore that you'd consider more difficult. When assigning chores, think about how specific your child needs you to be.

<strong>Chore lists.</strong> Maria Montessori set <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/mariamontessori/posts/10151850817851345" target="_blank">Facebook</a> a buzz by sharing the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flandersfamily.info/web/age-appropriate-chores-for-children/" target="_blank">Flanders Family’s list of "Age-Appropriate Chores for Children"</a> and cautioning against underestimating your child. It’s unfortunate that so many parents have used the ages attached to the chores to be overly critical or proud of their child and parenting (e.g., <a rel="nofollow" href="http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/age-appropriate-chores-for-children-and-why-theyre-not-doing-them/" target="_blank">Kj Dell’Antonia’s New York Times’ Motherlode blog post</a>). To encourage parents to think for themselves about which chores fit with their child and family, I’ve complied a list without ages attached to the chores; these self-care and family chores are roughly sorted by difficulty, based loosely on research about the difficulty of a variety of chores, as rated by caregivers of 132 children and youth ages 6-14 years with and without disabilities from different regions of the United States (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5014/ajot.2014.010454" target="_blank">Dunn, Magalhaes & Mancini, 2014</a>). Use your parent sense when considering any list; you know your child and family. For example, don’t send your child out to feed an unruly yard dog, and think twice about whether it’s a good idea to hand a broom over to a preschooler who has been hitting people with sticks lately.
