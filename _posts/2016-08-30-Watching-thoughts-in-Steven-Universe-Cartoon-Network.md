Steven Universe is an animated coming-of-age television series about the youngest member of a team of magical guardians of the universe. The “Mindful Education” episode that aired on August 25<sup>th</sup>, 2016 shows Steven and Connie having difficulty making training progress because they are struggling with and running away from unpleasant thoughts and feelings. Garnet uses the song, “Here Comes a Thought” (embedded above), to help them learn that it’s okay to watch painful thoughts and feelings instead of trying to avoid them&mdash;this frees them to do what they need to do to make training progress. This is a super kid-friendly way to introduce kids to mindfulness. Cartoon Network subscribers can stream the full 11-minute episode on <a rel='nofollow' href='http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/mindful-education-episode.html'>CartoonNetwork.com</a>.

<h5>Here Comes a Thought<br><small>by Rebecca Sugar</small></h5>
<p>
	[Garnet] Take a moment to think of just<br>
	Flexibility, love, and trust<br>
	Take a moment to think of just<br>
	Flexibility, love, and trust
</p>
<p>
	Here comes a thought<br>
	That might alarm you<br>
	What someone said<br>
	And how it harmed you
</p>
<p>
	Something you did<br>
	That failed to be charming<br>
	Things that you said are<br>
	Suddenly swarming
</p>
<p>
	And, oh, you’re losing sight, you’re losing touch<br>
	All these little things seem to matter so much<br>
	That they confuse you<br>
	That I might lose you
</p>
<p>
	Take a moment, remind yourself to<br>
	Take a moment and find yourself<br>
	Take a moment to ask yourself if<br>
	This is how we fall apart
</p>
<p>
	<i>But it’s not,</i><sup>(x5)</sup><br>
	<i>It’s okay,</i><sup>(x5)</sup><br>
	You’ve <i>got nothing,</i><sup>(x4)</sup> to fear<br>
	<i>I’m here,</i><sup>(x3)</sup>
