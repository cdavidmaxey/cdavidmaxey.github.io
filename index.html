        <p>Welcome to my private psychology practice <a href="{{site.url}}/contact/#address">conveniently located near I-5 in the Tigard Triangle area of Portland, Oregon on 72<sup>nd</sup> Avenue at 217</a>. I specialize in evidence-based psychotherapy and psychological evaluation for school-age children and teens, with a concentration in support for:</p>
			<h4>Challenging Behavior at School or Home</h4>
				<p>Having a wide variety of experience supporting the mental health needs of children and families in schools as well as office settings over the past {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2001 }} years, I have become practiced at working with teachers and parents to help kids in ways that fit with their classes at school and families at home.</p>
			<h4>Anxiety and Depression</h4>
				<p>I offer evidence-based psychotherapy drawing mainly from a newer cognitive behavioral treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, said as one word, “act”), which teaches young people how to manage emotions with flexibility to achieve goals and build healthy connections in life.</p>
			<h4>Difficulties with Inattention, Hyperactivity, and/or Impulsivity</h4>
				<p>I help children and families develop strategies to support on-task behavior, improve social relations, develop organizational habits, appreciate their unique strengths and weaknesses, and figure out solutions to difficulties.</p>
			<h4>Gender-Related Issues</h4>
				<p>Trans and gender-expansive children and youth usually encounter challenges at times over the years. When life is going well, I usually offer therapy sessions every 3-4 months to head off problems when they’re small, and build a therapeutic relationship for those times when the problems are really hard. I also offer psychological evaluations required to write the support letters that medical providers require for transition-related medical treatments.</p>
		<p>I work during school days as the Director of Student Support at a K-8 school, and I offer appointments to my private practice clients after school hours, on weekends, or over school breaks.</p>
		<p>I invite you to talk with me about my services and your needs, so we can find out if they might be a good fit. You can contact me at <!--sse--><a rel="nofollow" href="tel:{{site.tel}}">{{site.telephone | replace: '+1<span>(</span>', '(' | replace: '-', '&#8209;'}}</a><!--/sse--> or <!--sse--><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a><!--/sse-->. I’m often unable to answer the phone, so if I don’t answer your call, please leave a message with your availability for a return phone call. I usually return calls on the same or next day between 9am and 7pm, with the exception of weekends and holidays.</p>
        <p>Many appointment times are <a rel="nofollow" href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/schedule@cdavidmaxey.com/bookings/" target="_blank">offered online</a>. You’re also welcome to <a href="{{site.url}}/contact/">contact me directly</a> about scheduling and appointment times that aren’t shown online.</p>
