		<p>Welcome to my private psychology practice in the Tigard Triangle area of Portland, Oregon near the junction of I-5 and 217. I specialize in evidence-based psychotherapy and psychological evaluation for school-age children and teens, with a concentration in support for:</p>
			<h4>Challenging Behavior at School or Home</h4>
				<p>Through my years of experience providing mental health support in and for schools, I have become practiced at working with teachers to develop strategies that match with their classroom and work for students who have difficulty meeting expectations. I also help children and teens learn new ways to work out problems at home, using evidence-based approaches, such as collaborative problem-solving.</p>
			<h4>Anxiety and Depression</h4>
				<p>I offer evidence-based psychotherapy drawing mainly from a newer cognitive behavioral treatment, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, said as one word, “act”), which teaches young people how to manage emotions with flexibility to achieve goals and build connection.</p>
			<h4>Difficulties with Inattention, Hyperactivity, and/or Impulsivity</h4>
				<p>I help children and families develop strategies to support on-task behavior, improve social relations, develop organizational habits, appreciate their unique strengths and weaknesses, and figure out solutions to difficulties.</p>
			<h4>Gender-Related Issues or Dysphoria</h4>
				<p>Trans and gender-expansive children and youth usually encounter challenges at times over the years. Therapy sessions every 3-4 months when life is going well has the potential to head off problems when they’re small, and build a therapeutic relationship for those times when the problems are really hard. I also offer psychological evaluations required to write the support letters that medical providers require for transition-related medical treatments.</p>
		<p>Because I work during the school day as the Director of Student Support at a local school, I offer appointments after school hours, on weekends, or over school breaks. I invite you to talk with me about my services and your needs, so we can find out if they might be a good fit. You can contact me at <!--sse--><a rel="nofollow" href="tel:{{site.tel}}">{{site.telephone | replace: '+1<span>(</span>', '(' | replace: '-', '&#8209;'}}</a><!--/sse--> or <!--sse--><a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a><!--/sse-->. I’m often unable to answer the phone, so please leave a message with your availability for a return phone call. I usually return calls on the same or next day between 9am and 7pm, with the exception of weekends and holidays.</p>
