		<p class="allcaps notice-border">This notice describes how psychological and medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you can get access to this information. Please review it carefully.</p>
		<h3><span>I. </span>Uses and Disclosures for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations</h3>
		<div>
			<p>I may <i>use</i> or <i>disclose</i> your <i>protected health information (PHI)</i>, for <i>treatment, payment, and health care operations</i> purposes with your <i>consent</i>. To help clarify these terms, here are some definitions:</p>
			<div>
				<p><strong><i>“PHI”</i></strong> refers to information in your health record that could identify you.</p>
				<p><strong><i>“Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations”</i></strong></p>
				<div>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><i>Treatment</i></strong> is when I provide, coordinate or manage your health care and other services related to your health care. An example of treatment would be when I consult with another health care provider, such as your family physician or a psychologist.</li>
						<li><strong><i>Payment</i></strong> is when I obtain reimbursement for your healthcare. Examples of payment are when I disclose your PHI to your health insurer to obtain reimbursement for your health care or to determine eligibility or coverage.</li>
						<li><strong><i>Health Care Operations</i></strong> are activities that relate to the performance and operation of my practice. Examples of health care operations are quality assessment and improvement activities, business-related matters such as audits and administrative services, and case management and care coordination.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p><strong><i>“Use”</i></strong> applies only to activities within my office such as sharing, employing, applying, utilizing, examining, and analyzing information that identifies you.</p>
				<p><strong><i>“Disclosure”</i></strong> applies to activities outside of my office, such as releasing, transferring, or providing access to information about you to other parties.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3><span>II. </span>Uses and Disclosures Requiring Authorization</h3>
		<div>
			<p>I may use or disclose PHI for purposes outside of treatment, payment, and health care operations when your appropriate authorization is obtained. An <i>“authorization”</i> is written permission above and beyond the general consent that permits only specific disclosures. In those instances when I am asked for information for purposes outside of treatment, payment and health care operations, I will obtain an authorization from you before releasing this information.  I will also need to obtain an authorization before releasing your psychotherapy notes. <i>“Psychotherapy notes”</i> are notes I have made about our conversation during a private, group, joint, or family counseling session, which I have kept separate from the rest of your medical record. These notes are given a greater degree of protection than PHI.</p>
			<p>You may revoke all such authorizations (of PHI or psychotherapy notes) at any time, provided each revocation is in writing. You may not revoke an authorization to the extent that (1) I have relied on that authorization; or (2) if the authorization was obtained as a condition of obtaining insurance coverage, and the law provides the insurer the right to contest the claim under the policy.</p>
			<p>I will also obtain an authorization from you before using or disclosing:</p>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>PHI in a way that is not described in this notice.</li>
					<li>PHI for marketing purposes.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3><span>III. </span>Uses and Disclosures with Neither Consent nor Authorization</h3>
		<div>
			<p>I may use or disclose PHI without your consent or authorization in the following circumstances:</p>
			<div>
				<p><strong>Child Abuse:</strong> If I have reasonable cause to believe that a child with whom I have had contact has been abused, I am required to report the abuse to the Oregon Department of Human Services or the local law enforcement agency.  Additionally, if I have reasonable cause to believe that an adult with whom I have had contact has abused a child, I may be required to report the abuse.</p>
				<p><strong>Adult and Domestic Abuse:</strong> If I have reasonable cause to believe that any adult with whom I have had contact has been abused, I am required to report the abuse to the Oregon Department of Human Services or the local law enforcement agency. Additionally, if I have reasonable cause to believe that an adult with whom I have had contact has abused an adult, I may be required to report the abuse.</p>
				<p><strong>Health Oversight:</strong> The Oregon State Board of Psychology may subpoena relevant records from me should I be the subject of a complaint.</p>
				<p><strong>Judicial or Administrative Proceedings:</strong> If you are involved in a court proceeding and a request is made for information about your evaluation, diagnosis and treatment and the records thereof, such information is privileged under state law, and I must not release your information without written authorization by you or your personal or legally-appointed representative, or a court order. This privilege does not apply when you are being evaluated for a third party or where the evaluation is court-ordered. You will be informed in advance if this is the case.</p>
				<p><strong>Serious Threat to Health or Safety:</strong> I may disclose confidential information when I judge that disclosure is necessary to protect against a clear and substantial risk of imminent serious harm being inflicted by you on yourself or another person. I must limit disclosure of the otherwise confidential information to only those persons and only that content which would be consistent with the standards of the profession in addressing such problems.</p>
				<p><strong>Worker’s Compensation:</strong> If you file a worker’s compensation claim, this constitutes authorization for me to release your relevant mental health records to involved parties and officials. This would include a past history of complaints or treatment of a condition similar to that in the complaint.</p>
				<p><strong>When the use and disclosure without your consent or authorization is allowed under other sections of Section 164.512 of the Privacy Rule and the state’s confidentiality law:</strong> This includes certain narrowly-defined disclosures to law enforcement agencies, to a health oversight agency (such as HHS or a state department of health), to a coroner or medical examiner, for public health purposes relating to disease or FDA-regulated products, or for specialized government functions such as fitness for military duties, eligibility for VA benefits, and national security and intelligence.</p>
			</div>
			<p>There may be additional disclosures of PHI that I am required or permitted by law to make without your consent or authorization, however the disclosures listed above are the most common.</p>
