        <p class="center notice-border"><strong><i>If you&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have&nbsp;insurance or you&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;using&nbsp;insurance,</i> <br>you have the right to receive a “Good&nbsp;Faith&nbsp;Estimate” <br>explaining how much your medical and mental health care will cost.</strong></p>
        <p>Under the law, health care providers need to give <strong>clients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance</strong> an estimate of the bill for your health care items and services.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency health care, including psychotherapy services.</li>
            <li>Health care providers give you a Good Faith Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before a scheduled health care service. You can also ask your health care provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule a service.</li>
            <li>If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.</li>
            <li>Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.</li>
        </ul>
