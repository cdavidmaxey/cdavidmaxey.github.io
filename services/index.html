		<h3>Insurance</h3>
		<p>I’m an out-of-network provider for all insurance companies. I accept full payment  in cash or credit card at the time of service, and if you would like to use your out-of-network insurance benefits, I will provide a super bill that you can submit directly to your insurance company or through <a rel="nofollow" href="https://getbetter.co" target="_blank">GetBetter.co</a>, which charges 10% of the money you get paid back&mdash;it’s free if your claim is not covered by your insurance or is applied to your deductible.<!--I bill most insurance companies (except Kaiser and OHP) as an out-of-network provider, or you can pay out of pocket. Many insurance plans offer out-of-network benefits, and I understand that trying to navigate the financial aspects of receiving treatment, including insurance benefits, can be difficult and confusing. I’m happy to check your insurance benefits for you to help determine what your particular <span class="du">copay</span> and <span class="du">deductible</span> will be.--></p>

		<div>Suppose:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>my Standard Fee of $120/session,</li>
			<li>I am an out-of-network provider,</li>
			<li>your insurance company has an Allowed Fee of $100, and</li>
			<li>they cover 60% of the Allowed Fee.</li>
		</ul>
		<div>You would have:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>a copay of $40 (40% of the $100 Allowed Fee) and</li>
			<li>a remaining fee of $20 (the difference between the Standard Fee and the Allowed Fee).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Therefore, you pay $60/session and your insurance pays $60/session. If you submitted your claim through GetBetter.co, they would charge $6 (10% of the $60 insurance pays), and you would receive $54.</p>
